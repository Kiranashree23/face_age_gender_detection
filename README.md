# face_age_gender_detection
The system is able to detect face and recognize age &amp; gender of the persons in an image and in a video stream obtained from a camera in real time. Local Binary Pattern Histogram can recognize efficiently even if single training image is used for each person. Haar feature-based cascade classifiers in OpenCV approach for face detection. recognizer can recognize faces in different lighting conditions with high accuracy. Convolutional neural network models as caffe models it helps to recognize person age and gender.
